ENTREZ DIRECT - QUICK TOUR

Entrez Direct (EDirect) is an advanced method for accessing the NCBI's set of interconnected data domains (publication, nucleotide, protein, structure, variation, expression, etc.) from a terminal window. Multi-step queries can be built incrementally, and functions take search terms from command-line arguments. Record retrieval and formatting are normally the final steps in the query.

ENTREZ DIRECT FUNCTION SUMMARY

EDirect consists of a set of Perl scripts that are downloaded to the user's computer. Operations can be grouped into several categories.

Navigation functions support exploration within the Entrez databases:

  esearch     Performs a new Entrez search using terms in indexed fields.
  elink       Looks up neighbors (within a database) or links (between databases).
  efilter     Filters or restricts the results of a previous query.

Retrieval functions return document summaries or downloaded records:

  esummary    Obtains document summaries for the query results in XML format.
  efetch      Retrieves records or generates reports in a designated format.

Desired fields from XML results can be extracted without writing a program:

  xtract      Converts XML into a table of data values.

Several additional functions are also provided:

  einfo       Obtains information on indexed fields in an Entrez database.
  epost       Uploads lists of unique identifiers or sequence accession numbers.
  nquire      Sends a URL request to a web page or CGI service.

ENTERING QUERY COMMANDS

UNIX programs are run by typing the name of the program and then supplying any required or optional arguments on the command line. Argument names are letters or words that start with a dash ("-") character.

In order to begin an Entrez search, the user types "esearch" and then enters the required -db and -query arguments. For example, the command:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management"

constructs the appropriate Entrez Utilities (EUtils) URL from the query terms and executes the search. EDirect handles many technical details behind the scenes (avoiding the learning curve normally required for EUtils programming), and saves the results on the Entrez history server.

CONSTRUCTING MULTI-STEP QUERIES

The vertical bar ("|") UNIX pipe character connects two programs, sending the output of one to the input of the other. EDirect functions communicate the database, history key, and query number. Piping the esearch output to elink:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | elink -related

will look up related articles (precomputed PubMed neighbors) of the initial results. (Using elink -target retrieves associated records between databases.)

SPLITTING QUERIES ONTO MULTIPLE LINES

The same pair of commands can be written on two lines with the backslash ("\") UNIX line continuation character, for improved readability and easier editing:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related

RESTRICTING QUERY RESULTS

The current results can be refined by further term searching in Entrez:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "conotoxin NOT morphine"

QUALIFYING QUERIES BY INDEXED FIELD

Query terms can be qualified by entering an indexed field abbreviation in brackets. Boolean operators and parentheses can also be used in the query expression for more complex searches.

Some indexed fields from pubmed are:

  [AFFL]  Affiliation           [MAJR]  MeSH Major Topic
  [ALL]   All Fields            [SUBH]  MeSH Subheading
  [AUTH]  Author                [MESH]  MeSH Terms
  [FAUT]  Author - First        [WORD]  Text Word
  [PDAT]  Date - Publication    [TITL]  Title
  [FILT]  Filter                [TIAB]  Title/Abstract
  [JOUR]  Journal               [UID]   UID

and a fielded query looks like:

  "Tager H [AUTH] AND glucagon [TIAB]"

Indexed fields in the sequence databases include:

  [ACCN]  Accession      [ORGN]  Organism
  [ALL]   All Fields     [PROP]  Properties
  [AUTH]  Author         [PROT]  Protein Name
  [FKEY]  Feature Key    [SLEN]  Sequence Length
  [FILT]  Filter         [WORD]  Text Word
  [GENE]  Gene Name      [TITL]  Title
  [KYWD]  Keyword        [UID]   UID

and a sample query in the protein database is:

  "alcohol dehydrogenase [PROT] NOT (bacteria [ORGN] OR fungi [ORGN])"

The scripting examples at the end of this document will produce a report giving the entire set of indexed fields for every Entrez database.

EXAMINING INTERMEDIATE RESULTS

EDirect navigation functions produce a small structured XML object that is passed to the next command. Retrieval functions read the XML values and return the designated report from the history server.

The Count field in the XML intermediate gives the number of records returned by the previous step. A good measure of success is a reasonable (non-zero) value:

  <ENTREZ_DIRECT>
    <Db>pubmed</Db>
    <WebEnv>NCID_1_4586177_172.16.22.25_5555_1366675055_388385336</WebEnv>
    <QueryKey>4</QueryKey>
    <Count>10</Count>
    <Step>3</Step>
  </ENTREZ_DIRECT>

Checking the result count after each step can help avoid unsuccessful queries.

RETRIEVING PUBMED REPORTS

Piping the query results to efetch and specifying the "abstract" format:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "conotoxin NOT morphine" | \
  efetch -format abstract

returns a set of reports that can be read by a person:

  1. PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e59293. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0059293. Epub ...

Using "efetch -format medline" produces a report that can be read by common bibliographic management software packages:

  ...

XML DOCUMENT SUMMARIES

EDirect also provides a document summary in structured XML format for every record in every database. For example:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "conotoxin NOT morphine" | \
  esummary

will generate an XML document summary set:

  <eSummaryResult>
    <DocumentSummarySet status="OK">
      <DocumentSummary uid="23536870">
        <Id>23536870</Id>
        <PubDate>2013</PubDate>
        <EPubDate>2013 Mar 25</EPubDate>
        <Source>PLoS One</Source>
        <Authors>
          <Author>
            <Name>Sousa SR</Name>
            <AuthType>Author</AuthType>
            <ClusterID>0</ClusterID>
          </Author>
          <Author>
            <Name>Vetter I</Name>
          ...

The advantage of XML is that many pieces of information are in specific locations in a well-defined data hierarchy. Assembling individual units of data that are fielded by name, such as:

  <PubDate>2013</PubDate>
  <Source>PLoS One</Source>
  <Volume>8</Volume>
  <Issue>3</Issue>
  <Pages>e59293</Pages>

requires matching the same general pattern, differing only by the element name. This is much easier than parsing the units from a long, complex string:

  1. PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e59293 ...

The disadvantage of XML is that data extraction usually requires programming. But EDirect relies on the common pattern of XML value representation to provide a simplified approach to interpreting XML data, as discussed below.

CONVERSION OF XML DATA INTO TABULAR FORM

The xtract function uses command-line arguments to direct the selective conversion of XML data into a tab-delimited table. The -pattern argument divides the results into rows, while placement of data into columns is controlled by -element.

Additional arguments can limit data extraction to specified regions of the XML (-group, -block, and -subset), filter by data content (-match and -avoid) or elements (-present and -absent), and customize the table presentation.

Piping the esummary output to:

  xtract -outline

will give an overview of the XML structure hierarchy:

  DocumentSummarySet
    DocumentSummary
      Id
      PubDate
      EPubDate
      Source
      Authors
        Author
          Name
          AuthType
          ClusterID
          ...

The outline can help in deciding what arguments to send to xtract. Thus:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "conotoxin NOT morphine" | \
  esummary | \
  xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Id SortFirstAuthor Title

returns the PubMed identifier (PMID), first author name, and article title:

  23536870  Sousa SR  Expression and Pharmacology of Endogenous Cav Channels ...
  22410003  Vetter I  Characterisation of Na(v) types endogenously expressed ...
  18956616  Fürst Z   [Central and peripheral mechanisms in antinociception: ...
  12566085  Lo YK     Effect of arvanil (N-arachidonoyl-vanillyl-amine), a n ...
  ...

INTERACTION WITH UNIX UTILITIES

A tab-delimited table can be processed by many UNIX utiltiies. For example:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "conotoxin NOT morphine" | \
  esummary | \
  xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Id SortFirstAuthor Title | \
  sort -t $'\t' -k 2,2f -k 3,3f

takes the table from the previous example and sorts first by author name and then (if there are multiple publications by the same author) alphabetically by title:

  11000661  Chiang JS  New developments in cancer pain therapy.
  18956616  Fürst Z    [Central and peripheral mechanisms in antinociception ...
  10864900  Jerman JC  Characterization using FLIPR of rat vanilloid recepto ...
  12566085  Lo YK      Effect of arvanil (N-arachidonoyl-vanillyl-amine), a  ...
  ...

Alternatively, a frequency table of title words can easily be generated by passing the titles to a different set of UNIX commands:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "conotoxin NOT morphine" | \
  esummary | \
  xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Title | \
  sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/ /g' | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | xargs -n 1 | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1,1nr -k 2,2f

The "sed" (stream editor) command takes the article titles and removes punctuation and accented characters, replacing them with a space and thus creating separate words. Piping to "tr" (translate) converts capital letters to lower case. The "xargs -n 1" command places each resulting word on a separate line. The words are then sorted alphabetically (by "sort"), and occurrence counts for each unique word are calculated (by "uniq"). Finally, the results are sorted by frequency:

  8 of
  7 in
  4 cells
  4 human
  4 neuroblastoma
  4 sh
  4 sy5y
  ...

PUBMED ARTICLE XML RECORDS

The PubmedArticle object has a more detailed structure than the DocumentSummary, and is only available for records in the pubmed database:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "conotoxin NOT morphine" | \
  efetch -format xml | \
  xtract -outline

and more information is fielded, including author names:

  PubmedArticleSet
    PubmedArticle
      MedlineCitation
        PMID
        DateCreated
          Year

              LastName
              ForeName
              Initials
            ...

Using this information to craft a new xtract statement:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "capsaicin cancer pain management" | \
  elink -related | \
  efilter -query "conotoxin NOT morphine" | \
  efetch -format xml | \
  xtract -pattern PubmedArticle -element "MedlineCitation/PMID" LastName

results in a table of all authors for each record:

  23536870  Sousa   Vetter  Ragnarsson  Lewis
  22410003  Vetter  Mozar   Durek       Wingerd  Alewood  Christie  Lewis
  18956616  Fürst
  12566085  Lo      Chiang  Wu
  ...

(Note that -element "MedlineCitation/PMID" uses the parent/child construct to prevent picking up PMIDs that occur later in CommentsCorrections objects. The -first or -last arguments can be used instead of -element, if appropriate.)

EXPLORATION OF XML SETS

Individual PubmedArticles can be retrieved directly by efetch:

  efetch -db pubmed -id 1937004 -format xml

The resulting XML may contain a list of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH Terms):

  ...
  <MeshHeadingList>
    <MeshHeading>
      <DescriptorName>Adenosine Triphosphatases</DescriptorName>
    </MeshHeading>
    <MeshHeading>
      <DescriptorName>Amino Acid Sequence</DescriptorName>
    </MeshHeading>
    <MeshHeading>
      <DescriptorName>Base Sequence</DescriptorName>
    </MeshHeading>
    ...

A -block statement visits each individual MeSH object. Customizing the output format (by changing the tab between fields to a newline character):

  efetch -db pubmed -id 1937004 -format xml | \
  xtract -pattern PubmedArticle -tab "\n" -element "MedlineCitation/PMID" \
    -block MeshHeading -tab "\n" -element DescriptorName

produces a list of MeSH terms, one per line, following the PubMed ID:

  1937004
  Adenosine Triphosphatases
  Amino Acid Sequence
  Base Sequence
  ...
  Recombination, Genetic
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins

NESTED EXPLORATION OF SUBSETS WITHIN XML SETS

MeSH terms may have one or more subheadings:

    ...
    <MeshHeading>
      <DescriptorName>Recombination, Genetic</DescriptorName>
      <QualifierName>genetics</QualifierName>
    </MeshHeading>
    <MeshHeading>
      <DescriptorName>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</DescriptorName>
      <QualifierName>genetics</QualifierName>
      <QualifierName>radiation effects</QualifierName>
    </MeshHeading>
    <MeshHeading>
      <DescriptorName>Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins</DescriptorName>
    </MeshHeading>
  </MeshHeadingList>
  ...

Adding a -subset statement within the -block allows nested exploration of the subheadings for each MeSH term:

  efetch -db pubmed -id 1937004 -format xml | \
  xtract -pattern PubmedArticle -tab "" -element "MedlineCitation/PMID" \
    -block MeshHeading -pfx "\n" -tab "" -element DescriptorName \
      -subset QualifierName -pfx "/" -tab "" -element QualifierName

and results in a list of MeSH terms and associated subheadings:

  1937004
  Adenosine Triphosphatases
  Amino Acid Sequence
  Base Sequence
  ...
  Recombination, Genetic/genetics
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/radiation effects
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins

RECORDING VALUES IN VARIABLES

A value can be recorded in a variable and then displayed multiple times as needed. Variables are indicated by a hyphen followed by a string of capital letters or digits. The variable "-PMID" is referred to as "&PMID" in an -element argument.

For example:

  efetch -db pubmed -id 1937004 -format xml | \
  xtract -pattern PubmedArticle -PMID "MedlineCitation/PMID" \
    -block MeshHeading -tab "\n" -element "&PMID",DescriptorName

produces a list of MeSH terms, with the PMID in the first column of each row:

  1937004  Adenosine Triphosphatases
  1937004  Amino Acid Sequence
  1937004  Base Sequence
  ...
  1937004  Recombination, Genetic
  1937004  Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  1937004  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins

CONDITIONAL PROCESSING

Xtract provides arguments that filter by data content (-match and -avoid) or elements (-present and -absent). Parallel statements are used to handle alternative conditions. For example:

  efetch -db pubmed -id 1937004 -format xml | \
  xtract -pattern PubmedArticle -PMID "MedlineCitation/PMID" \
    -group MeshHeading \
      -block MeshHeading -present QualifierName \
        -subset DescriptorName -TERM "DescriptorName" \
        -subset QualifierName -tab "\n" -element "&PMID","&TERM",QualifierName \
      -block MeshHeading -absent QualifierName \
        -subset DescriptorName -tab "\n" -element "&PMID",DescriptorName

has separate sections for MeSH terms with and without subheadings, and produces:

  1937004  Adenosine Triphosphatases
  1937004  Amino Acid Sequence
  1937004  Base Sequence
  ...
  1937004  Recombination, Genetic             genetics
  1937004  Saccharomyces cerevisiae           genetics
  1937004  Saccharomyces cerevisiae           radiation effects
  1937004  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins

SELECTING XML ATTRIBUTES

The MeSH term and subheading fields actually have major topic attributes:

  <MeshHeading>
    <DescriptorName MajorTopicYN="N">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</DescriptorName>
    <QualifierName MajorTopicYN="Y">genetics</QualifierName>
    <QualifierName MajorTopicYN="N">radiation effects</QualifierName>
  </MeshHeading>

that can be selected as "DescriptorName@MajorTopicYN" or simply "@MajorTopicYN":

  efetch -db pubmed -id 1937004 -format xml | \
  xtract -pattern PubmedArticle -PMID "MedlineCitation/PMID" \
    -group MeshHeading \
      -block MeshHeading -present QualifierName \
        -subset DescriptorName -TERM "DescriptorName" -MAJR "@MajorTopicYN" \
        -subset QualifierName -tab "\n" \
          -element "&PMID","&TERM","&MAJR",QualifierName,"@MajorTopicYN" \
      -block MeshHeading -absent QualifierName \
        -subset DescriptorName -tab "\n" \
          -element "&PMID",DescriptorName,"@MajorTopicYN"

The results are suitable for importing into a database or spreadsheet program:

  1937004  Adenosine Triphosphatases          N
  1937004  Amino Acid Sequence                N
  1937004  Base Sequence                      N
  ...
  1937004  Recombination, Genetic             N  genetics           N
  1937004  Saccharomyces cerevisiae           N  genetics           Y
  1937004  Saccharomyces cerevisiae           N  radiation effects  N
  1937004  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins  Y

EXPLORING SEPARATE XML REGIONS

Multiple -block statements can be used in a single xtract to explore different areas of the XML. This limits element extraction to the desired subregion, and allows disambiguation of fields with identical names.

Combining fields with commas allows them to be treated as sets. The tab that normally separates these can be replaced with a -sep argument:

  efetch -db pubmed -id 781293,2678811,6301692,8332518 -format xml | \
  xtract -pattern PubmedArticle -element "MedlineCitation/PMID" \
    -block AuthorList -sep "/" -element LastName "#Author" \
    -block PubDate -sep " " -element Year,Month MedlineDate \
    -block DateCreated -sep "-" -element Year,Month,Day | \
  sort -t $'\t' -k 3,3n | column -s $'\t' -t

produces a table that allows easy parsing of author names, counts the number of authors present, and prints the date each record was published and the date it was entered into PubMed, sorting the results by the computed author count:

  781293   Casadaban                         1  1976 Jul      1976-10-02
  6301692  Krasnow/Cozzarelli                2  1983 Apr      1983-06-17
  8332518  Benson/Lipman/Ostell              3  1993 Jul      1993-08-17
  2678811  Mortimer/Schild/Contopoulou/Kans  4  1989 Sep-Oct  1989-11-22

(The PubDate object can exist either in structured or string form, but would not contain a mixture of both types, so "-element Year,Month MedlineDate" will only contribute a single column to the output.)

STORING COMMON PHRASES IN ALIAS FILES

Frequently used, long, or complicated search phrases can be saved in a file to avoid having to retype (or copy and paste) the full text for each query. Each line of the file has a shortcut keyword, a tab character, and the expanded search term. Shortcuts are referenced by placing them in parentheses and prefixing with a pound ("#") sign.

For example, given a file named "query_aliases" containing:

  jour_filt    [MULT] AND ncbijournals [FILT]
  trans_imm    (transposition OR target) immunity

the esearch line in:

  esearch -alias query_aliases -db nlmcatalog -query "Science (#jour_filt)" | \
  esummary | \
  xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element ISOAbbreviation \
    -subset ISSNInfo -sep "|" -element issn,issntype | \
  column -s $'\t' -t

will be expanded to:

  esearch -db nlmcatalog -query "Science [MULT] AND ncbijournals [FILT]"

with the query producing:

  J. Zhejiang Univ. Sci.  1009-3095|Print  1009-3095|Linking
  Science (80- )          0193-4511|Print  0193-4511|Linking
  Science                 0036-8075|Print  1095-9203|Electronic  ...

LINKING TO SEQUENCE DATABASES

Using elink with the -target argument will link to associated records in the destination database:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "conotoxin AND nicotinic acetylcholine receptor" | \
  elink -target protein

Filtering can then be done using indexed fields in the protein database:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "conotoxin AND nicotinic acetylcholine receptor" | \
  elink -target protein | \
  efilter -query "mat_peptide [FKEY]"

SEQUENCE RECORDS IN INSDSEQ XML

Sequences shown in GenBank or GenPept flatfile format have features that describe our current understanding of the biology encoded in that region.

Sequence records can be retrieved in an XML version of the GenBank or GenPept flatfile. Feature and qualifier names are data values, not XML tags, and require -match to select the desired object. A query for snail venom mature peptides:

  esearch -db pubmed -query "conotoxin AND nicotinic acetylcholine receptor" | \
  elink -target protein | \
  efilter -query "mat_peptide [FKEY]" | \
  efetch -format gpc -mode xml | \
  xtract -pattern INSDSeq -ACCN INSDSeq_accession-version \
    -group INSDFeature -match ">mat_peptide<" \
        -avoid "<INSDFeature_partial" -pfx "\n" -element "&ACCN" \
      -block INSDQualifier -match ">peptide<" -element "%INSDQualifier_value" \
      -block INSDQualifier -match ">product<" -element INSDQualifier_value \
      -block INSDQualifier -match ">peptide<" -element INSDQualifier_value | \
  grep conotoxin | sort -t $'\t' -u -k 3,4 | \
  sort -t $'\t' -k 2,2n | column -s $'\t' -t

calculates the length of each mature peptide, and prints the product name and peptide sequence, removing redundant entries and sorting by peptide length:

  AAN78127.1  12  alpha-conotoxin ImII  ACCSDRRCRWRC
  AAN78128.1  12  alpha-conotoxin ImI   GCCSDPRCAWRC
  AAO33169.1  16  alpha-conotoxin GIC   GCCSHPACAGNNQHIC
  ABE27006.1  25  conotoxin p114a       FPRPRICNLACRAGIGHKYPFCHCR
  ABE27007.1  25  conotoxin p114.1      GPGSAICNMACRLGQGHMYPFCNCN
  ABE27008.1  25  conotoxin p114.2      GPGSAICNMACRLEHGHLYPFCHCR
  ABE27009.1  25  conotoxin p114.3      GPGSAICNMACRLEHGHLYPFCNCD
  ...

(The sequence accession is captured in a variable for use with each mat_peptide in the record. Prefix substitution ensures that every peptide is shown on a separate line. This also works for multi-product precursor proteins such as proinsulin.)

(Incorporating fragments of the surrounding XML tags in -match arguments prevents coincidental matches to free text in note qualifiers.)

Multiple -avoid or -match conditions are specified with -and and -or commands:

  -group INSDFeature -avoid ">proprotein<" -and ">sig_peptide<" \
    -block INSDQualifier -match ">calculated_mol_wt<" -or ">peptide<" \

EXTENSIVE MODIFICATION OF TABULAR OUTPUT

The normal column-oriented output can be extensively modified to produce a custom report. A query on a gene that undergoes messenger RNA splicing:

  efetch -db nuccore -id "GQ370762.1" -format gbc -mode xml | \
  xtract -pattern INSDSeq -pfx ">Feature " -sfx "\n" -tab "" -first INSDSeqid \
    -group INSDFeature -avoid "INSDFeature_key>source<" -FKEY INSDFeature_key \
      -block INSDInterval -element INSDInterval_from INSDInterval_to \
        INSDInterval_point INSDInterval_point "&FKEY" -FKEY "" -tab "" -lbl "\n" \
      -block INSDQualifier -avoid ">translation<" -and ">peptide<" -pfx "\t\t\t" \
        -sfx "\n" -tab "" -element INSDQualifier_name,INSDQualifier_value

clears the feature key variable after its first use to generate the 5-column feature table format used for GenBank submissions:

(A location interval will have either an INSDInterval_from and INSDInterval_to pair or a single INSDInterval_point. Additional work would be required to support the 5' and 3' partial flags for features with incomplete locations.)

AUTOMATION WITH SCRIPTS

Taking an adventurous plunge into the world of programming, a shell script can be written when each output line of one step needs to be processed independently, instead of output being piped in its entirety to the next command. (The simplest shell script can be merely a copy of the set of commands that are typed into the terminal for execution.)

In shell scripts, variables can be set to the results of a command by enclosing the statements in backtick ("`") characters. The variable name is prefixed by a dollar sign ("$") to use its value as an argument in another command. Comments start with a pound sign ("#") and are ignored. Quotation marks within quoted strings are "escaped" with a backslash ("\"). Subroutines can be used to collect common code or simplify the organization of the script.

For example:

  #!/bin/bash -norc

  parse_fields() {
    echo "$1" | \
    xtract -pattern Field -element Name FullName Description | \
    sort -t $'\t' -k 2,2f | \
    perl -pe 's/(.+?)\t(.+?)\t(.+)/\[$1\]\t$2\t$3/' | \
    column -s $'\t' -t
  }

  dbs=`einfo -dbs | xtract -pattern DbName -element DbName | sort`

  for db in $dbs; do
    eix=`einfo -db $db`

    echo "$db"
    echo ""
    flds=`parse_fields "$eix"`
    echo "$flds"
    echo ""

    sleep 1
  done

will obtain the list of Entrez databases, and then return the abbreviations, names, and descriptions of indexed search fields, for each individual database:

AUTOMATION WITHOUT SCRIPTS

Creative use of the "sh" and "xargs" commands can obtain the same behavior from the command line, without the need to write separate script files. Within the "sh" command string, the database argument passed by xargs is substituted at the "$0" variable. All of the sh commands are run separately on each database.

Because the sh instructions are enclosed between single quote ("'") characters (apostrophes), in-line perl commands cannot be used, nor can sort be told to use tabs (instead of tabs or spaces) to delimit columns. But a combination of xtract customization and the trick of temporarily replacing spaces with asterisks:

  einfo -dbs | xtract -pattern DbName -element DbName | sort | \
  xargs -n 1 sh -c 'einfo -db "$0" | \
    xtract -pattern DbInfo -tab "\n\n" -element DbName \
      -block Field -pfx "[" -sep "]\t" -tab "\n" -element Name,FullName | \
    sed "s/ /*/g" | sort -k 2,2f | sed "s/*/ /g" | expand'

allows the desired sorting by full field name and produces results that are alphabetized for each database:
